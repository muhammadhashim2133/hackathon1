This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

This project is deployed on vercel you can check it on (https://hackathon1-muhammadhashim2133.vercel.app)

### I used:

1. Next.js 13.4+ Tailwind CSS, and Shadcn UI.
2. Implemented cart functionality using Vercel Postgres SQL and Drizzle ORM.

3. Connected to Sanity as back end CMS with all the product Data.

4. Connected Stripe APIs to power online payment processing for e-commerce.

5. Useed React-hot-toast library to adds beautiful notifications.

6. Useed Icons from Lucid (default from Shadcn-UI).
7. Stripe Test Credit Cards for payment.
8. Used redux for state managment.
9. Used clerk for authentication.

#### Things to remember

1. `.env` and `env.development.local` files are not on Github.you need to setup manually.
2. `npm install styled-components` to use Sanity and `npm uninstall styled-components` to deploy on vercel.
